The performance of Fitts's Law is worse as the size of the target becomes larger (x) 
-> target size S가 커지면 접근시간 T는 줄어듬

The performance of Fitts's Law is better as the location of the target gets closer to user's hand(or a mouse)  (o)
-> D가 짧아지면 접근시간 T가 줄어듬

Fitts's Law is about accuracy of moving your hand to a target (x)

It takes logarithmic time to perform Fitts'Law task. (0) 

Steering Law task is easier than Fitts'Law task (x)
->Steering 은 difficulty가 linear , Fitts's는 logarithmic

# Task flow

- Task flow show detailed screens and functions (x) -> not too detailed
- Task flows are used to create a concept video (x)
- Task flows show how various features work together (o)
- Task flows show design specifics of each step for performing a task (o)
- Task flows cannot show screen transitions (x)

# Visibility (visibility (2))

- Making commands visible
 - Menus
 - Tooltips
 - Self-disclosure

- Make *Modes Clearly Visible
 - Vi's insert mode vs command mode
 - Caps Lock
 - Drawing palette
 * Modes : states in which actions have different meanings

- Visible navigation state
 - Breadcrumbs
 - Pagination
 - Tabs 

- Feedback : Actions Should have immediately visible effects
 - Low-level feedback : push button
 - High-level feedback : model state change,new web page starts loadin

- Visible model states : Continuos visual representation of model 
 - Showing the current page (현재 페이지)
 - 글자수 

- Visible View States
 - Selection highlight 
 - Selection handles
 - Drag & drop 

- Visibility of actions : use Appropriate Affordances
  - Button & links
  - Drop-down arrows
  - Texture
  - Mouse Cursor
  - Highlight on mouseover 

- Information scent : Cues on a link that indicate how profitable it will be to follow the link to its destination
 - provide a visual cue for a link


 # System,interface,user model
 
 - interface model shoud match the system model closely 
 - The methaphor of RealCD player's CD case is an example of an interface model
 - System model is the model that the system presents to the user 
 - Direct manipulation uses visual metaphors of physical interaction for improving interface model 

# Predictive evaluation 

- Posting a photo to instagram can be usefully modeled by keystroke-level model

# quantitative information in visual design
- color is not recommended

# Design Exploration 
: Prototyping,Storyboarding,Brainstorming,Sketching (not include needfinding)

# 퀴즈

- home btn 만들때 고려해야할 것 : Fitts' Law 
- number of Menu items 만들때 고려해야할 것 : Hick-Hyman Law of Reaction Time


# three interaction styles 

- Direct manipulation requires error messages
- Command languages can be very efficient for new users
- Command Languages are synchronous 
- Command languages has better learnability than mewnus and forms
- Command languages and menuand forms are more accessible than direct manipulation
